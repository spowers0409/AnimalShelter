# AnimalShelter
<h3>About the Project/Project Title</h3>
<p>This project is about creating an interactive dashboard layout that allows a user to identify pets; dogs and cats, and then filter results based on breed, location, type of rescue dog it is, etc.</p?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The motivation behind this project is to learn how to filter databases out in a graphically friendly atmosphere for any one person to be able to use. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>There are only a few items that are needed here to be able to log in and add or update information within the database. 

First step would be to log in to the database that one is trying to utilize. This can be done in a few short steps:
<li>Log into you mongoDB account via the command line
<li>Use the AAC database 
<p>Now once we are in the database, it is now time to run the program. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The tools needed are fairly simple. There are two files that will need to be downloaded and running from your home directory, or you can create a new folder inside your home directory. Download both AnimalShelter.py and ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb. From here you will be able to utilize the CRUD method from the .py file, and view your dashboard from the .ipynb file.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The dashboard is fairly simple to use as it will break down the animals into many different subcategories, all of which are viewable. There is also the map that starts off showing your location and the common animal breeds in your area. </p>
<p>Then there are 3 radio buttons, of which layout the 3 specific rescue dogs “Disaster Rescue, Mountain Rescue, and Water Rescue”. There is also a reset option to cancel out of the rescue dogs and go back to viewing all animals.</p>
